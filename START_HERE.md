## 🎯 Your Paths

### Path A: Manual Verification First

**Best if:**
- You want to ensure features work
- You want to find bugs first
- You prefer manual testing

**Your 30-minute journey:**
1. Open: `VERIFICATION_PLAN.md`
2. Read: Introduction (5 min)
3. Test: Phase 1 manually (10 min)
4. Document: Findings (10 min)
5. Next: Continue to Phase 2

**Result:** Know exactly what works/fails

---

### Path B: Quick Test Implementation

**Best if:**
- You want to see code fast
- You like copy-paste solutions
- You prefer coding to reading

**Your 1-2 hour journey:**
1. Open: `TESTING_QUICK_START.md`
2. Find: "User Service" section
3. Copy: Test configuration file
4. Create: Test Java files (5 files)
5. Run: `mvnw test`
6. Check: Coverage report
7. Repeat: For other services

**Result:** Tests working immediately

---

### Path C: Comprehensive Learning

**Best if:**
- You want to understand testing deeply
- You have 4 weeks to implement
- You want the best possible coverage

**Your 4-week journey:**
- **Week 1:** Read guides, expand user-service, 80%+ coverage
- **Week 2:** Test masterdata + inventory, 70%+ each
- **Week 3:** Test order-processing + integration, 60%+ each
- **Week 4:** Frontend tests + final touches

**Result:** Production-ready test suite
